    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This homemade take on the classic Hamburger Helper beef pasta is hearty, creamy, and packed with flavor.  
        Tender ground beef is simmered with savory seasonings, pasta, and a rich, cheesy sauce to create the ultimate comfort food.  
        It's an easy one-pan dinner that comes together quickly, tastes even better than the boxed version, and is fully gluten-free so the whole family can enjoy it.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Medium Diced Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>3 Cloves Garlic</li>

        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>6 oz Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Chili Powder</li>
        <li>4 Cups Beef Stock</li>
        <li>8 oz Gluten Free Farfalle or Mafalda Pasta (I use Jovial)</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup Sour Cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Cups Shredded Mild Cheddar Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat, add the olive oil and heat through.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and continue to sauté until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef. Breaking it up and cooking until the meat is browned, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and chili powder.</li>
        <li>Add the beef stock and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes (the cooking time may differ depending on the pasta shape).</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the sour cream, and cheddar cheese. Stirring until the cheese has melted and everything is incorporated.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Corn-based pasta doesn't work as well in this recipe. The flavor and texture can be off. Stick with rice-based pasta for the best results.</li>
        <li>If using beef broth, add 1 tsp beef bouillon to boost the richness of the sauce.</li>
    </ul>
