        <li>1/2 Cup Sour Cream</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Lemon Juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large deep skillet over medium high heat, and add the olive oil.</li>
        <li>Add the beef. Season with salt and pepper. Brown until well seared and mostly cooked. Remove from pan.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the pan, scraping up the browned bits in the pan, then add the diced onion and mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and sauté until the onions and mushrooms are softened.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and continue to sauté until the garlic is fragrant, about a minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in the white wine to deglaze and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until it is almost completely evaporated.</li>
        <li>Add the beef back into the pan and heat it through, bout 1-2 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour, making sure to evenly coat everything, and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the beef broth, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, and thyme. Stir to incorporate everything.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta, bring to a boil and cover. Cook until the noodles are cooked through, about 9-10 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the sour cream, and lemon juice. Stirring until the sour cream is incorporated fully.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Corn-based pasta doesn't work as well in this recipe. The flavor and texture can be off. Stick with rice-based pasta for the best results.</li>
        <li>Beef stock can be used instead of beef broth for a richer and fuller taste.</li>
    </ul>
